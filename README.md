# html-portfolio
a basic design for your html portfolio.

Step into a world where your digital persona takes center stage. This innovative portfolio design draws inspiration from collectible game cards, placing you as the featured character in your own professional story. The following things are the website features:

1. Landing Page (index,html):
   The moment you arrive, you're greeted by a striking visual - a sleek, minimalist design featuring a game card-style display. At its heart is a dual portrait encased in a premium card holder, showcasing different facets of your professional identity. The word "PORTFOLIO" spans the top, setting the tone for this unique presentation of your skills and experiences.
   My design incorporates a gradient background that shifts from cool white to warm orange, symbolizing the spectrum of your capabilities. The bytearchiv logo, tastefully placed, adds a stamp of quality to your digital presence.

2. Game Stats Page (second.html):
   Delve deeper into your professional profile with our "Game Stats" section. Here, your skills are quantified and displayed in an intuitive, game-like format. UI/UX Design, Full Stack Web Development, and JavaScript proficiencies are visualized through progress bars, giving viewers an immediate grasp of your technical prowess.
   This page maintains the sleek aesthetic of the landing page, featuring a striking portrait that commands attention while your skills take center stage.

3. Main Info Page (third.html):
   For those seeking a comprehensive overview of your professional journey, the main info page delivers. It's a full-screen resume, artfully designed to balance visual appeal with informative content. Your education, work experience, and an expanded list of skills are presented in a clean, easy-to-read layout.
   The page is anchored by a full-body silhouette image, adding a touch of mystery and sophistication to your professional narrative. The gradient background persists, tying all pages together in a cohesive visual experience.

Throughout the site, you'll find mentions of @bytearchiv - this is where curious viewers can explore more of my work on Instagram.
